So, basically they did the same thing but in different way. But the main difference
between the two is that we can't redirect reference one to some other variable
like once you refer some variable you can't change it to some other variable
but we can do it in case of pointer we can assign the existing pointer (which is 
pointing somewhere) to point to some other variable.

/*Yes — your understanding is *basically correct*. Nice work writing those examples and comments. Below I’ll tidy up a few small but important clarifications and show tiny examples that prove the differences so there’s no doubt.

# Short confirmation

* **Reference** is an *alias* (another name) for an existing variable. Once created it always refers to that same object.
* **Pointer** is a variable that *stores an address*. You can change the pointer to point somewhere else.

Your comments in the code are right — just add the small caveats below.

---

# Important clarifications (short & plain)

1. `r = something` for a reference assigns a *value* into the original variable — it **does not** rebind the reference to another object.
   Example:

   ```cpp
   int x = 5, y = 7;
   int& r = x;   // r is alias for x
   r = y;        // this writes y's value (7) into x => x becomes 7
   // r still refers to x
   ```

2. You **can** reassign a pointer to point elsewhere:

   ```cpp
   int* p = &x;  // p points to x
   p = &y;       // p now points to y
   ```

3. A reference **must** be initialized when declared. A pointer **does not** have to be (but an uninitialized pointer is garbage and unsafe).

   ```cpp
   int& r;   // compile error — must initialize
   int* p;   // allowed, but p contains garbage until you assign it
   ```

4. References normally **cannot be null** (there’s no standard safe null reference). Pointers can be null (`nullptr`) and you must check before dereferencing.

5. **Do not** return a reference to a local (automatic) variable — that creates a dangling reference (undefined behavior).

   ```cpp
   int& bad() { int x = 5; return x; } // BAD — x dies when function returns
   ```

6. `&` has two meanings:

   * In a type (`int&`) it declares a reference.
   * As an operator (`&x`) it means “address of x”.

---

# Quick runnable examples to prove the points

A — reference shows same address as original and `r = y` is assignment, not rebinding:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int x = 5, y = 7;
    int& r = x;
    cout << "&x = " << &x << ", &r = " << &r << '\n'; // same address
    r = y; // copies value 7 into x
    cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y << '\n';     // x == 7, y == 7
}
```

B — pointer can be reseated:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int x = 5, y = 7;
    int* p = &x;
    cout << "p -> " << p << ", *p = " << *p << '\n';
    p = &y; // p now points to y
    cout << "p -> " << p << ", *p = " << *p << '\n';
}
```

C — reference cannot be left uninitialized, pointer can (but dangerous):

```cpp
int& r;    // compile error
int* p;    // allowed (but p has garbage value until set)
```

---

# Very short final summary

* Think of a **reference** as a permanent nickname for a variable. You use it exactly like the original name.
* Think of a **pointer** as a signpost that stores an address. You can point the signpost somewhere else whenever you want.

Your comment block at the end of your message is correct — just keep the above caveats in mind (initialization, nullability, and dangling issues).

Want a short exercise I can give you to test these ideas on your machine? (I’ll include expected output so you can check.)
